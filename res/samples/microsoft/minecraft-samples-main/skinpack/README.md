# Minecraft Tutorial Sample Skinpack

This is a sample skin pack. To find the skin, import the pack (as explained below), launch Minecraft, and go to the Classic Skins area of the dressing room. The Tutorial Skin Pack should be listed.

## What Do I Do with This?

To make using this as easy as possible, I saved this as an .mcpack file.

To use it, download it and then double-click it. It will launch Minecraft and copy itself into the **skin_packs** folder in your **com.mojang** folder.

If you want to make changes to it, rename the file from **skins.mcpack** to **skins.zip** and then extract the contents like you would any other .zip file. Be sure to change the UUIDs in **manifest.json** before you try to import it again!

If you have any trouble with the **skins.mcpack** file, then download the .zip file and rename it to **skins.mcpack**.
