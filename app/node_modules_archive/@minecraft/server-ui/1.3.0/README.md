# `@minecraft/server-ui`

The `@minecraft/server-ui` module contains types for expressing simple dialog-based user experiences.



  * [*@minecraft/server-ui.ActionFormData*](../../minecraft/server-ui/ActionFormData.md) contain a list of buttons with captions and images that can be used for presenting a set of options to a player.

  * [*@minecraft/server-ui.MessageFormData*](../../minecraft/server-ui/MessageFormData.md) are simple two-button message experiences that are functional for Yes/No or OK/Cancel questions.

  * [*@minecraft/server-ui.ModalFormData*](../../minecraft/server-ui/ModalFormData.md) allow for a more flexible "questionnaire-style" list of controls that can be used to take input.
